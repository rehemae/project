#ABOUT
 
Since the promulgation of the new constitution that was declared in August 2010 marked the end of a centralized system of government and ushered in the decentralized system of government that led to the creation of 47 counties with the aim of decentralizing power, services and public resources. This ambitious system shifts some of the key decision making roles from national to Neighbourhood Association creating a window for more bottom up.
The policy on the devolved system of government acknowledges that the quantity of public participation is low and has not been optimized due to challenges in accessing information.
 
 
#The project description
 
This project is a Web App platform that will connect community and neighborhood associations in order to increase public participation. It will be built and inspired by AkiraChix Software Developer students based on the fact that public participation is low and has not been optimized due to challenges in accessing information. The Paza Project's goal is to increase public participation by creating a platform where the community can easily access information.
 
#Users of the system:
 
Neighborhood Associations and the community.
